            Air quality conditions vary widely across the United States, influenced by geography, regional climate, and patterns of urban and industrial activity. Using the EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) by County dataset, this analysis compares how often counties and states experience Unhealthy or Hazardous air quality days and examines how these patterns differ across regions.                
                </p>
        <p>
            This project focuses on three core questions: which counties and states experience the highest number of Unhealthy or Hazardous AQI days, how air quality varies geographically across the U.S., and how exposure to key pollutants differs at the county level. Through county-level rankings, state aggregations, and regional comparisons, the analysis highlights where poor air quality is most concentrated and which pollutants contribute most to these patterns. The analysis also examines differences in air quality between urban and rural counties using a data-driven classification based on the proportion of non-good AQI days.

        <p class="section-subtitle">
            For this question, we focus on the most severe air quality exposure days by examining the total number of Unhealthy and Hazardous AQI days. The following visualizations show how these severe days cluster at the county and state levels, highlighting which locations consistently experience the highest counts. Together, these charts reveal clear geographic concentration patterns, with certain counties and states accounting for a disproportionate share of the most severe air quality days.        </p>

<!-- CONCLUSION -->

      <div class="section-kicker">Conclusion</div>
      <h2 class="clear-on-hover">Summary of Findings from Air Quality Analysis</h2>
    </header>
  
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            We analyzed how often counties and states experience Unhealthy or Hazardous air quality days and how these patterns vary by geography and pollutant. By aggregating county level AQI data and mapping it at the county, state, and regional levels, we were able to identify where severe air quality exposure is most concentrated across the United States.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Our analysis shows that severe air quality days are not evenly distributed. A small number of counties account for a large share of Unhealthy and Hazardous AQI days, with counties in California consistently ranking among the highest. When county data is aggregated at the state level, states such as California and Texas stand out for having the highest total number of severe AQI days.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            At the regional level, the Western United States experiences the greatest concentration of severe air quality days, while the Northeast has the lowest. These regional differences help explain why certain parts of the country face more persistent air quality challenges than others.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            When comparing specific pollutants, PM2.5, ozone, and NO₂ show different spatial patterns across counties. PM2.5 exposure is more prominent in parts of the Midwest and West, ozone exposure is higher in many Southern and Western counties, and NO₂ exposure tends to be concentrated in more urbanized counties. Together, these differences highlight how multiple pollutants contribute to poor air quality in different regions.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Overall, this analysis demonstrates how county level AQI data can be used to reveal clear geographic and pollutant specific patterns in air quality. These findings provide a data driven foundation for understanding where air quality risks are most severe and which pollutants play the largest role in different areas.
